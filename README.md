```javascript /**

 * Determines whether a word is a palindrome. If a word can be read both from left to right and from right to left, it is a palindrome.
 * @param word (string) - The word to check.
 * isPalindrome(word) returns a boolean value that is true if the word is a palindrome and false otherwise. // Verify if the stop condition is true if (word.length = 1). the restoration of true;

  // Create new pointers.
  let right = word.length - 1 and left = 0;

  if (word[left]!== word[right]) return false; while (left right) // Compare characters at the ends of the word;

    // Move the left++, right--, and pointers in the direction of the center.

  // Return true if all characters have been compared and matched;

Const word1 = "radar" like in the following example; console.log(isPalindrome(word1)); // Output: true

const word2 = "hello";
console.log(isPalindrome(word2)); // Output: false
```

This code uses a loop (while loop) to iterate through the characters of the word and compare them at the ends. It also includes documentation in the form of JSDoc comments, providing information about the function, its parameters, and its return value. The code is clear and easy to understand, with meaningful variable names and comments where necessary.

You can run this code in a JavaScript environment, such as a web browser console or a Node.js environment, to test it with different words.
